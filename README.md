🖼️ Image Classification Model
This project implements an Image Classification system using deep learning. The model is trained to classify images into different categories such as cats vs dogs, handwritten digits (MNIST), or custom classes.

🚀 Features
Load and preprocess image dataset

Build and train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Evaluate model performance

Predict new, unseen images

Visualize training metrics (accuracy/loss)

Save and load trained models

🧰 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

OpenCV / PIL for image handling

📁 Dataset
You can use standard or custom datasets, such as:

CIFAR-10

MNIST

Cats vs Dogs

Any custom image dataset structured like:
